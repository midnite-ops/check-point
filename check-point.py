# # Write a Python class named Point3D defined by x, y, and z. Define a method that returns (x, y ,z). This tells Python to represent this object in the following format: (x, y, z). Then create a variable named my_point containing a new instance of Point3D with x=1, y=2, and z=3 and print it.

# # Suppose we want to model a bank account with support for deposit and withdraw operations. Letâ€™s create a Python class named Bank defined by its balance. Define two methods, deposit and withdraw, to compute the new amount of each operation.
